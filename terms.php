          <h4>7. USE OF COPYRIGHT MATERIAL AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT</h4>
          <p>Sites must not contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material including links or redirects to copyright
            material hosted on 3rd party websites / resources. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the
            rights to publish material, not for <?=$global['title'];?> to prove that you do not. <?=$global['title'];?> does not allow the
            propagation or distribution of copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.
          </p>
          <h4>8. ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE</h4>
          <p>Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources. These include bandwidth, processor utilization and / or
            disk space. Please see the 'High Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <h4>9. BACKUPS / REQUESTING DATA BACKUP</h4>
          <p>It is the client / account holders responsibility to maintain and keep backups of website and MySQL data. We do
            not provide data restores from our archives / restoring a website or database to an earlier version. We also do
            not provide free backups / archives of customers own current data. We reserve the right to charge a fee of 14.99
            USD if we are requested to create a backup on a customers behalf. We may choose to waive this fee under
            circumstances of our choosing.
          </p>
          <h4>10. SCRIPT USAGE TERMS</h4>
          <p>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an application
            server. Using the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is
            not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present
            values to ensure the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they are resource
            intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to
            provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.
          </p>
          <p>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a single email based upon user
            entered information, or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform processor
            intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or
            from a <?=$global['title'];?>-hosted domain.
          </p>
          <p>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources, or other sites on the same
            server
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of not allowed script and website types include (but are not limited to):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pornographic/adult content</li>
            <li>Proxy scripts</li>
            <li>Chat scripts</li>
            <li>Bitcoin / cryptocurrency faucet sites</li>
            <li>File sharing / file storage scripts</li>
            <li>Autolike scripts</li>
            <li>Hacking scripts / PHP shell scripts</li>
            <li>Phishing</li>
            <li>Mass mail scripts</li>
            <li>Website scraping/crawling/downloading scripts</li>
            <li>Torrents</li>
            <li>Warez</li>
            <li>Cracked/pirated content of any kind</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>11. USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS</h4>
          <p><?=$global['title'];?> offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate
            web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website
            and linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content. We will
            treat all password protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio
            and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not
            acceptable.
          </p>
          <p>Archives of movie files, audio files, zips, rars or any large volumes of files used for downloading / sharing is
            not allowed.
          </p>
          <h4>12. RIGHT TO SUSPEND / TERMINATE HOSTING SERVICES</h4>
          <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any hosting services if a website/hosting service consumes excessive
            server resources or effects other websites / hosting services on a shared or clustered hosting server. Excessive
            resource usage can constitute any form of server usage calculated and determined at the discretion of
            <?=$global['title'];?>. <?=$global['title'];?> reserves the right to suspend service at any time without prior notice if or when the
            health or normal running / performance of a service is effected / degraded by a website or hosting service.
          </p>
          <p>You acknowledge that <?=$global['title'];?> may or may not pre-screen Content, but that <?=$global['title'];?> and its designees
            shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any
            Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, <?=$global['title'];?> and its designees shall
            have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you
            must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the
            accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on
            any Content created by <?=$global['title'];?> or submitted to <?=$global['title'];?>, including without limitation information in
            <?=$global['title'];?> Message Boards and in all other parts of the Service.
          </p>
          <p>You acknowledge, consent and agree that <?=$global['title'];?> may access, preserve and disclose your account information
            and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is
            reasonably necessary to:
          </p>

            <li>enforce the TOS;</li>
            <li>respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties;</li>
            <li>respond to your requests for customer service; or </li>
            <li>protect the rights, property or personal safety of <?=$global['title'];?>, its users and the public.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may
            involve
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>transmissions over various networks; and</li>
            <li>changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that
            permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by
            <?=$global['title'];?> and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or
            circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication, further
            distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly
            prohibited.
          </p>
          <h4>13. INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON <?=$global['title'];?> NETWORK</h4>
          <p>When you register with <?=$global['title'];?>, you acknowledge that in using <?=$global['title'];?> services to send electronic
            communications (including but not limited to email, uploading photos and files and other Internet activities),
            you will be causing communications to be sent through <?=$global['title'];?>'s computer networks, portions of which are
            located in California, Ohio, UK, and other locations in the United States and portions of which are located
            abroad. As a result, and also as a result of <?=$global['title'];?>'s network architecture and business practices and the
            nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the
            transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of
            transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to this Terms of Service, you acknowledge that use of the service results
            in interstate data transmissions.
          </p>
